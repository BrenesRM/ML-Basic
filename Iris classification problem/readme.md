Iris Dataset Classification 

To build the Python files and provide a step-by-step explanation for the Iris classification problem, we will:  

1. Import necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset.  
2. Split the data into training and test sets.     
3. Inspect the data (basic exploration).  
4. Train a machine learning model.  
5. Evaluate the model's performance.  
6. Save the Python script file.

This project demonstrates the classification of the Iris dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The script performs data visualization, model training, evaluation, and prediction. A scatter matrix plot is generated and saved as an image file (iris_scatter_matrix.png).  

##Features  
Dataset Loading: Uses the built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
Data Splitting: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
Visualization: Creates a scatter matrix plot of the features, colored by the target labels, and saves it as a PNG image.
Model Training: Trains a k-NN classifier on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the classifier's accuracy on the test set.
Prediction: Predicts the species of a new sample data point.
