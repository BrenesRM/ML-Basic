Workflow Steps
Define Problem:

Clearly understand the problem you're trying to solve (e.g., image classification, regression, etc.).
Identify the dataset, target variables, and evaluation metrics.
Build Neural Network Architecture:

Design the architecture of the neural network (e.g., number of layers, type of layers, and activation functions).
Collect (or Add More) Data:

Gather and preprocess the dataset.
If needed, augment the dataset to improve model performance.
Train for an Epoch:

Train the model on the training dataset for one epoch (one complete pass through the dataset).
Check Error on Training Data:

Evaluate if the error on the training data is decreasing. If not, return to the architecture step to modify the network or collect more data.
Check Error on Validation Data:

If the error on the validation dataset is not decreasing, this could indicate overfitting or poor generalization. You may need to adjust hyperparameters or collect more data.
Evaluate Training Data Performance:

Ensure the model is performing well on training data. If not, return to previous steps to refine the training process.
Evaluate Test Data Performance:

If the model performs well on training data but not on test data, it may be overfitting. Techniques like regularization, dropout, or adding more data can help.
Finish:

If the model performs well on both validation and test datasets, the training process is complete.
