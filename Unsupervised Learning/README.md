# Unsupervised Learning and Preprocessing Examples

This repository contains Python scripts that explore key concepts in unsupervised learning, preprocessing techniques, and dimensionality reduction, as outlined in the provided class briefing. Each script includes examples and visualizations to aid understanding.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`unsupervised_clustering.py`**: Demonstrates clustering techniques (K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN) with visual examples.
- **`dimensionality_reduction.py`**: Explores dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, NMF) and their applications, including visualization.
- **`data_preprocessing.py`**: Covers scaling techniques (`StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `RobustScaler`) and their effects on data distribution.
- **`tensorflow_basics.py`**: Introduces TensorFlow for building a simple neural network, with training loss visualization and prediction results.
